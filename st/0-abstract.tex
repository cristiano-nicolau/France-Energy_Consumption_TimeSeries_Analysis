This study focuses on the analysis and forecasting of monthly electricity consumption in France, utilizing Eurostat data from 2008 to 2025. To achieve this, we compared several statistical time series models, specifically SARIMA, ETS, and STLM.
Our evaluation revealed that the manually parameterized SARIMA model exhibited the lowest values for information criteria (AIC, AICc, and BIC), indicating a better balance between model fit and complexity. However, the SARIMA model with automatic parameter selection stood out due to its superior predictive capability on the test set, demonstrating the lowest errors (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Theil's U). In contrast, the ETS and STLM\_ARIMA models showed inferior performance in both evaluations.
