# Gas Consumption Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the time series analysis of daily natural gas consumption data in mainland Portugal. The dataset provides historical records, enabling the exploration of consumption patterns, trends, and forecasting opportunities for research and educational purposes.

The total daily gas consumption is divided into two main market segments:
- **Electric Market**: Natural gas consumed by combined cycle power plants for electricity generation.
- **Conventional Market**: Natural gas used for domestic and industrial purposes.

The Conventional Market is further divided into three categories:
- **GRMS – Distribution**: Gas delivered to GRMS for consumption in Distribution Networks.
- **High Pressure Clients**: Gas delivered to GRMS for clients directly connected to the High Pressure network.
- **UAG – Autonomous Gasification Units**: Gas consumed by units not directly connected to the pipeline.

A "gas day" is defined as the period from 5:00 AM to 5:00 AM the following day.

The dataset supports exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
