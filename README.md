# Air Quality Prediction

## Overview
This dataset contains hourly averaged responses from a chemical multisensor device deployed at street level in a heavily polluted area of an Italian city. The data was collected over the span of one year, from March 2004 to February 2005, making it one of the longest publicly available field recordings from air quality chemical sensors.

The device included 5 metal oxide chemical sensors, and its readings were recorded alongside reference ground truth measurements from a certified analyzer.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes:
- 9357 instances representing hourly averages.
- Sensor data from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors.
    - Target air pollutants (Ground Truth):
    - Carbon Monoxide (CO)
    - Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC)
    - Benzene (C6H6)
    - Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
    - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

- Meteorological data:
    - Temperature
    - Relative Humidity
    - Atmospheric Pressure

- Missing values are represented by -200.
