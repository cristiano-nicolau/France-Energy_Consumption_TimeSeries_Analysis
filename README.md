# Energy Consumption in France

## Overview

This project presents a time series analysis of monthly energy consumption in France. Using historical data, the goal is to explore consumption patterns, trends, and forecasting opportunities, with a focus on research and educational applications.

The dataset provides monthly records of energy consumption (in GWh), enabling exploratory analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

## Objectives

1. Analyze monthly energy consumption in France.
2. Identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends.
3. Develop predictive models to estimate future energy consumption.

The dataset used can be found here: [France Energy Consumption Dataset](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_cb_em/default/table?lang=en).
